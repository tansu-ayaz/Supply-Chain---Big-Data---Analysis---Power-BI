# Supply-Chain-Big-Data-Analysis - Power-BI

## Description

The supply chain industry is the engine that runs every economy in the world.  Weâ€™ve seen firsthand the impact in the disruption of the supply chain industry when covid 19 hit the world in late 2019.  With the massive amount of data available from point of sales to online transactions, an advanced approach for analyses and prediction of the future state of any supply chain operation will be beneficial to both businesses and customers. In this project, we analyze data from a fictional sporting goods supplier to identity what are the key variables that impact the smooth delivery of products to their order destination.

 In this project, Using Power Bi and Excel, We will explore key variables from the fictional sporting goods supplier to identify how those variables can be used to explain whether an order for goods and services will be delivered to the retail store on time.
